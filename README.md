# ALiG - Academic literacy in German

This project contains the pipeline to pre-annotate txt-files to import them into Inception and annotate them with the Beldeko and GerSumCo annotation guidelines.

Steps:
1. Start Preprocess.py to start analysing files
2. The program will ask you to add orig+target to the directory
3. Start Preprocess.py again

If you want to add new sentence boundaries:
1. Use Boundaries.py
2. The program will ask you to add new boundaries to m_sen_boun
3. Start Boundaries.py anew
